1. POST method is used when we need to create new document in our application while PUT is used when we need to update the whole document.
2. DELETE is not safe since it is used to delete a document. So every time a DELETE request is sent to the server it deletes some resource on the server.
   It is idempotent in the sense that it can delete only one document. So, every time a DELETE request is sent to the server it should look for the selected 
   resource and delete it. It should do nothing if the resource does not exist.
3. While it is possible to update a resource using GET method, but the rest standard does not encourage this approach.
4. Every REST response should contain proper status header based on the request. For e.g., a get method should have a 200 OK status code, update is 201,
   server errors are 50*. Also, the response data should be consistent. Every error response should have an error code and a message in the response object.
   Similarly, every successful response should contain a  data property in the response object.
5. Paging is important to prevent high traffic on the server and scale the application. So not every resource is loaded at once with every request. 
   Caching is important so the client (browser) need not request the server for the same resource every time but instead keep a copy of the resource on the client.
